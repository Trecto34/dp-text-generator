<p align="center">
An algorithm was created that loads 3 layers of LSTM, each containing 128 neurons that will run for 4 epochs reading the data (the text in this case) 256 times in each.
Then we ask this algorithm to generate new text based on the patterns it has detected.
Note that the larger the text, the longer each epoch will take, but the better the result will be.
